# Security Awareness Landing Page

⚠️ Educational Use Only  

This project simulates how attackers might build a phishing landing page combined with a client-side keylogger to exfiltrate data.  
It is strictly for **cybersecurity training and awareness** in a controlled lab environment.

## Purpose

- Demonstrate how phishing UIs are crafted to lure users.  
- Show how JavaScript keylogging techniques can capture keystrokes.  
- Illustrate how exfiltration to a remote endpoint (e.g., Telegram bot, HTTP server) could occur.  
- Train defenders to recognize, detect, and prevent such threats.

## Features

- Responsive "fake" landing page
- Mock form that simulates data entry
- Example scripts showing how keystrokes could be logged
- Exfiltration simulated to a safe, local endpoint (not real C2)
- Designed for classroom / lab use

## Tech Stack

- HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, Python
